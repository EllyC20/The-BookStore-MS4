# Testing of The Book Store

## Testing Navigational Bar 

### Brand Name
* When I click the brand name "The Book Store" I expect to be taken to the home page. I tested this by using a laptop, Ipad and mobile device and physically clicking the brand name. By doing this I confirmed the expected results. 
### Navigational Links
* Within the navigational bar there are three main options, "All Products", "Categories" and "Contact". 
    * When clicking "All Products" I expect to be shown the products page which displays all products within the database. I tested this using a laptop, Ipad and mobile device and physically clicking the navigational link. I cross referenced the products with the database to confirm all were present. This confirmed all expected results.
    * When clicking "Categories" I expect to be shown a drop down menu featuring all of the categories listed within the database. I checked this by visiting the database and cross referencing the shown results. I tested this using a laptop, Ipad and mobile device and physically clicking the navigational link. This confirmed the expected results.
    * CONTACT FORM TO BE COMPLETED.

 ## Testing the "CTA" (call to action) button
 * On the homepage there is a button shown on the carousel. The button says "Shop Now" and when clicked should take the user to the "All Products" page. I tested this by using a laptop, Ipad and mobile device and physically clicking the button. By doing this I confirmed the expected results.

 ## Footer 
 * Within the Footer, there are 2 navigational options for within the website and 2 social media icons. 

### Social Media Icons 
* The social media icons featured are Instagram and Facebook. When clicked they should take the user to the social media website in a new tab. I tested this by clicking the icons. Upon doing this I noted that I hadn't included links to the social media sites or the target "_blank" attribute. I fixed these errors and tried again. This confirmed the expected behaviour.

### Returns & FAQ Pages 
* Upon clicking the "Returns" link, users should be taken to the "Returns" page. I checked this by clicking the link, this confirmed the expected behaviours. 
* Upon clicking the "FAQ" link, users should be taken to the "FAQ" page. I checked this by clicking the link, this confirmed the expected behaviours. 

## Search Function 
* The expected behaviour of the search function is that, upon entering a valid input the site will be searched for a matching result. If there is no result the user should be informed of this. To test this I firstly entered the word "zoo" as I knew a book title matched this. The results confirmed the expected behaviour, I was shown one result named "Dear Zoo". The site url reflected the search, as it showed "?q=zoo" as anticiapted. 
* I then entered the word "grow" and this did not have any results. However this did not confirm the anticipated results as there was not an error message. ERROR MESSAGE FIX TO BE IMPLEMENTED.
* The search function should check the name of the book, the name of the author and also the description for the key word. 
    * I checked this was working by typing the name "Stephen" this gave two results of books both written by an author with the name Stephen. 
    * I then checked the description by using the word "learn", this gave one result and the word learn was within the description of this book.
