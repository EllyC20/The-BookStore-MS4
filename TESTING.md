# Testing of The Book Store

## Testing Navigational Bar 

### Brand Name
* When I click the brand name "The Book Store" I expect to be taken to the home page. I tested this by using a laptop, Ipad and mobile device and physically clicking the brand name. By doing this I confirmed the expected results. 
### Navigational Links
* Within the navigational bar there are three main options, "All Products", "Categories" and "Contact". 
    * When clicking "All Products" I expect to be shown the products page which displays all products within the database. I tested this using a laptop, Ipad and mobile device and physically clicking the navigational link. I cross referenced the products with the database to confirm all were present. This confirmed all expected results.
    * When clicking "Categories" I expect to be shown a drop down menu featuring all of the categories listed within the database. I checked this by visiting the database and cross referencing the shown results. I tested this using a laptop, Ipad and mobile device and physically clicking the navigational link. This confirmed the expected results.
    * CONTACT FORM TO BE COMPLETED.
 ## User And Basket 
 
 ## Testing the "CTA" (call to action) button
 * On the homepage there is a button shown on the carousel. The button says "Shop Now" and when clicked should take the user to the "All Products" page. I tested this by using a laptop, Ipad and mobile device and physically clicking the button. By doing this I confirmed the expected results.

 ## Footer 
 * Within the Footer, there are 2 navigational options for within the website and 2 social media icons. 

### Social Media Icons 
* The social media icons featured are Instagram and Facebook. When clicked they should take the user to the social media website in a new tab. I tested this by clicking the icons. Upon doing this I noted that I hadn't included links to the social media sites or the target "_blank" attribute. I fixed these errors and tried again. This confirmed the expected behaviour.
