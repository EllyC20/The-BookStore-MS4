            The Book Store began in 1982 under the aegis of its founder, Tim Waterstone. Over the decades that have
            followed, we have grown to become an icon of the Irish cultural landscape, employing over 3000 superb
            booksellers across over 280 bookshops.

            As the last surviving national bookshop chain, under the helmsmanship of Managing Director James Daunt, we
            are proud to have fought off the perceived threat of e-readers and online competition to begin a programme
            of active expansion. Recent years have seen fresh shops open around the country and sites either move or be
            upgraded. With recent openings including Reigate, Clifton and moves to far more attractive locations for our
            shops in Edinburgh and Manchesterâ€™s Trafford Centre, our plans continue to be ambitious.

            Perhaps unusually for a national retailer, our branch managers enjoy a high degree of individual autonomy,
            running their shops to best please their local customers, with only the lightest of central suggested
            direction. We take enormous pleasure in championing simply good (but sometimes relatively overlooked) books,
            a principle that began most famously with John Williamsâ€™ Stoner, a quiet, intense novel that we turned into
            a bestseller forty years after its original publication.

            Working closely with our bookshops are our efforts online, where at The Book Store.com we are working to bring
            the very essence of The Book Store to every home and smartphone in Ireland. With hugely popular endeavours such
            as our regular reading update The Book Store Weekly and an ever-increasing offering of exclusive reader offers
            and signed editions, The Book Store.com is the perfect online companion to our High Street bookshops. Click &
            Collect â€“ the service that links the two â€“ has grown in tandem with our success, allowing our customers to
            experience the best of both worlds.
